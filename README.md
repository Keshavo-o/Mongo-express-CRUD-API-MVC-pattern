# MVC Pattern in My Project
This document explains the MVC (Model–View–Controller) architecture and how it has been implemented in this project. The purpose of using MVC is to organize the code into separate, logical sections for better maintainability, scalability, and readability.
## 1. What is MVC?
MVC stands for Model–View–Controller. It is a software design pattern commonly used for developing web applications. It separates the application into three main components:
• Model – Handles the data and database logic.
• View – Presents data to the user (UI). In this project, we send JSON responses instead of HTML templates.(currently not included in this repository)
• Controller – Contains the business logic, processes requests, and sends responses.
## 2. How MVC Works
1. The client sends an HTTP request.
2. The router decides which controller should handle the request.
3. Middleware (if present) processes the request before the controller.
4. The controller executes the application logic and interacts with the model.
5. The model communicates with the database and returns data.
6. The controller sends the processed response back to the client.
## 3. Project Structure
The project is organized into the following folders and files:

#### • Controllers/ – Contains controller functions for handling specific routes.
#### • Models/ – Contains Mongoose schemas and models for MongoDB.
#### • Routes/ – Defines application routes and maps them to controllers.
#### • Middlewares/ – Contains middleware functions for request logging, validation, etc.
#### • Database conn/ – Contains database connection logic.
#### • app.js – Main entry point of the application, sets up Express, middleware, and routes.
## 4. Example Flow in This Project
1. A GET request is sent to `/users/123`.
2. Middleware checks if the user with ID 123 exists.
3. If the user exists, the request is passed to the `handleGetUserById` controller.
4. The controller fetches the user from the database using the `user` model.
5. The controller returns the user data as a JSON response.
## 5. Benefits of Using MVC
• Separation of concerns – Each part of the application has its own responsibility.
• Easier maintenance – You can modify one layer without affecting the others.
• Scalability – New features can be added without disrupting the existing structure.
• Reusability – Code can be reused across different parts of the application.
6. Conclusion
By following the MVC architecture, this project achieves a clean, modular, and maintainable structure. This approach helps in scaling the application and makes it easier for multiple developers to work on different parts of the project without conflicts.
